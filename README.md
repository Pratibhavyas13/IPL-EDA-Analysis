# IPL EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

##  Project Overview
This project aims to analyze IPL (Indian Premier League) matches and ball-by-ball data from 2008 to 2020. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, we uncover trends, player performances, team statistics, and match dynamics.

## Dataset Information
- **IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020** (`IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020.csv`): Contains detailed ball-by-ball match data.
- **IPL Matches 2008-2020** (`IPL Matches 2008-2020.csv`): Includes match-level details such as venues, teams, toss results, and player awards.

##  Exploratory Analysis Conducted
- **General Match Statistics**:
  - Total matches played
  - Unique venues and cities
  - Participating teams and umpires

- **Toss Analysis**:
  - Most frequent toss winners
  - Distribution of toss decisions

- **Player Performance Analysis**:
  - Most "Player of the Match" awards
  - Comparisons of Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, and other key players

- **Batting Analysis**:
  - Total runs scored by top batsmen
  - Shot distribution (singles, doubles, boundaries, sixes)
  - Dismissal types

- **Visualizations**:
  - Bar plots for player comparisons
  - Pie charts for run distributions
  - Interactive graphs using Plotly

##  Requirements
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
```python
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

##  How to Use
1. Load the datasets using `pandas.read_csv()`.
2. Perform EDA using `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, and `Matplotlib`.
3. Run the provided analysis scripts to generate insights.
4. Visualize key findings using bar charts and pie graphs.

##  Sample Insights
- The most successful toss-winning teams.
- Virat Kohliâ€™s performance trends over different IPL seasons.
- Distribution of player dismissals and high-scoring matches.

##  Future Scope
- Predictive analysis of team performance.
- Advanced player profiling using Machine Learning.
- Real-time IPL match tracking and analysis.
